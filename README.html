This is a four-compartment model of a L5PC as described in
M&auml;ki-Marttunen T, Halnes G, Devor A, Metzner C, Dale AM,
Andreassen OA, Einevoll GT: "A stepwise neuron model fitting procedure
designed for recordings with high spatial resolution, application to
layer V pyramidal cells", Journal of Neuroscience Methods (2017), from
which Figures 1-4 and parts of Figure 8 are reproduced in this entry.

The single-cell model is fitted to behave in a similar fashion as that
described in:

Hay E, Hill S, Schuermann F, Markram H, and Segev I (2011)
"Models of neocortical layer 5b pyramidal cells capturing a wide range
of dendritic and perisomatic active properties"
PLoS Comput Biol 7:e1002107.

The network model is fitted to behave in a similar fashion as that
described in:

Hay E and Segev I (2015)
"Dendritic Excitability and Gain Control in Recurrent Cortical
Microcircuits"
Cerebral Cortex 25(10):3561-71.

Four folders are included in this ModelDB entry:

single_cell:     NEURON implementation for single-cell
simulations. The modeldb auto-launch runs here (mosinit.hoc) and
produces the following graph which corresponds to the blue trace in
figure 4C in the paper:

single_cell_NML: NeuroML2 description of the single-cell model
snmf:            Python scripts for running the parameter optimizations
network:         Python/NEURON implementation for network simulations

Please see the readme's in the above folders and if needed this
additional help file which explains how to run NEURON models:
